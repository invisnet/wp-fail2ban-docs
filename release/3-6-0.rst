3.6.0
-----

* The :ref:`reference_filters` are now generated from PHPDoc in the code. There were too many times when the filters were out of sync with the code (programmer error) - this should resolve that by bringing the patterns closer to the code that emits them.
* Added PHPUnit tests. Almost 100% code coverage, with the exception of :ref:`WP_FAIL2BAN_PROXIES` which is quite hard to test properly.
* Bugfix for :ref:`wordpress-soft_conf`.
* Add :ref:`WP_FAIL2BAN_XMLRPC_LOG`.
* Add :ref:`WP_FAIL2BAN_REMOTE_ADDR`.
* :ref:`WP_FAIL2BAN_PROXIES` now supports an array of IPs with PHP 7.
