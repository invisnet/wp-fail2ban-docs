Upgrade
^^^^^^^

This is an experimental release. If your current version is working and you're not interested in the new features, skip this version - wait for 2.1.0. For those that do want to test this release, note that `wordpress.conf` has changed - you'll need to copy it to `fail2ban/filters.d` again.
