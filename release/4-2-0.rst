4.2.0

* Completed support for :ref:`WP_FAIL2BAN_COMMENT_EXTRA_LOG`.
* Add support for 3rd-party plugins; see :ref:`developers`.

  * Add-on for Contact Form 7 (experimental).
  * Add-on for Gravity Forms (experimental).

* Change logging for known-user with incorrect password; previously logged as unknown user and matched by `hard` filters (due to limitations in older versions of WordPress), now logged as known user and matched by `soft`.
