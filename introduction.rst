History
-------

As with many open source projects, `áº€P fail2ban` started as way to scratch a particular itch. I had a dedicated server that was getting some unwelcome attention from various bots, and while it was trivial to configure `fail2ban` for ``ssh`` etc, WordPress was another story. Thus `WP fail2ban` was born late November 2011.

Since then it's slowly but steadily accumulated features, and much to my surprise, gained a considerable number of installs (30,000+ at the time of writing) - I really had no idea so many other people would be interested!

Between versions 3.5 and 3.6 there was a bit of a delay. I switched my development environment from Windows 10 [#f1]_ to a FreeBSD workstation and a Linux laptop, life then decided to take its turn and get in the way for a bit, all while the shadow of Gutenberg loomed large over the future of WordPress. With the advent of `ClassicPress <https://classicpress.net/>`_ [#f2]_ things started to look sunnier, so I dusted off the repo, put together some better documentation, braved the horrors of ``svn``, and got 3.6 out the door as a pseudo 7th anniversary present in November 2018.


.. _future:

Future
------

Version 4 was born from a desire to visualise the things *WPf2b* was logging; being entirely separate and distinct from the core functionality, adding this as freemium features seemed like a good plan. Time will tell.

This logical separation will continue for all future versions - if you were happy with the way 3.6 worked you'll be happy with future versions too.
